This document contains SQL queries to answer the open-ended questions from the Fetch Data Analyst take-home assessment. 

1. Who Are Fetch’s Power Users?
Identify Fetch's power users based on their purchasing behavior. A power user is defined as someone who belongs to the top 10% of total spenders.

Assumptions
The users_spend table contains user data along with their total spend (TOTAL_SPEND) and total quantity (TOTAL_QUANTITY).
Power users are those whose total spend falls within the top 10% of all users.
Spending distribution follows a continuous trend, and the threshold for power users is determined using the 90th percentile.

2. Which Is the Leading Brand in the Dips & Salsa Category?

Determine the leading brand in the "Dips & Salsa" category based on total sales and the number of items sold.

Assumptions
The transactions table contains purchase records linked to product details through the barcode field.
The products table categorizes products using the category_2 column, where "Dips & Salsa" is a valid category.
The leading brand is defined as the one with the highest total sales (FINAL_SALE). In case of a tie, the brand with the highest quantity (FINAL_QUANTITY) sold will be chosen.

3. At What Percent Has Fetch Grown Year Over Year?
Calculate Fetch's year-over-year (YoY) growth percentage based on total sales in each year.

Assumptions
The transactions table contains purchase records with a purchase_date column in YYYY-MM-DD format.

Growth is calculated using the formula:

(current year’s sales − previous year’s sales/ previous year’s sales) × 100

If sales data for the previous year is unavailable, growth should return NULL.
